Because it has been shown to perform well relative to other genetic score development approaches in both the previous study (Xu et al. Cell Genomics, 2022) and the benchmark carried out in this study. Additionally, Bayesian ridge has been shown to scale well to large numbers of traits, thus improving computational efficiency and consistency with green computing (Lannelongue et al. Advanced Science, 2021).",

      type: "Genetic score development",
      text: "To ensure the generalizability of genetic score models when applied to other cohorts, a variant filtering step was first performed for all the traits considered, which applied a MAF threshold of 0.5% and excluded all multi-allelic variants as well as ambiguous variants (i.e. A/T, G/C). A follow-up LD thinning step was carried out at an r2 threshold of 0.8 on all the variants, which aims to remove a certrain level of LD dependencies among variants and reduce the computational burden of genetic scoring method. The remaining variants were then filtered at the genome-wide significance threshold of 5e-8 (based on their GWAS summary statistics conducted on the INTERVAL training samples) for each trait. ",
